Number squaring
Complete the following program so that the square1() and square2() functions work properly.
// Square the given number x
function square1(x) {
  // TODO: complete the function code
}

// Square the given number x
const square2 = x => // TODO: complete the function code

console.log(square1(0)); // Must show 0
console.log(square1(2)); // Must show 4
console.log(square1(5)); // Must show 25

console.log(square2(0)); // Must show 0
console.log(square2(2)); // Must show 4
console.log(square2(5)); // Must show 25
When it's done, update the program so that it shows the square of every number between 0 and 10.
Writing 10 dumb calls to square() is forbidden! You know how to repeat statements, don't you? 
Minimum of two numbers
Let's pretend the JavaScript Math.min() function doesn't exist. Complete the following program so that the min() function returns the minimum of its two received numbers.
// TODO: write the min() function

console.log(min(4.5, 5)); // Must show 4.5
console.log(min(19, 9));  // Must show 9
console.log(min(1, 1));   // Must show 1
